<!--
    You need an index.html file 
    Moralis won't allow you to host anything if it doesn't have an index.html file
    Create JSON file for each NFT token. The JSON filename should be the tokenID
    Within the JSON file, post the properties of the NFT mentioned in Moralis website
    We must have an image for each tokenID and we must also host the image somewhere
    Go to "Paint" and draw some image for each tokenID - WHITE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD
